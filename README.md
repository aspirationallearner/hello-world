# hello-world

Hello everyone!

I'm currently a university student and I believe that all branches of knowledge are inherently connected. My university tries to integrates these streams of knowledge, both successfully and unsuccessfully. Even though I'm not in the program, my qualms with the program is that people don't seem to actually enjoy learning but instead are doing the program for their resume. I might be wrong and perhaps casting too much judgement. 

I currently want to double major and triple minor. I wish I had an advisor who could guide me in creating the perfect academic program for me, however the academic advisors are very shallow in their guidance.
